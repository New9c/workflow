# Hello!

This is a backup of my current workflow, just in case my laptop explodes for some reason :D
But having a backup is not the only reason I'm making this, I also want to share it with you!
I currently use Arch BTW, so the install scripts will work best with arch (and maybe only arch...)

## Quick install
If you are me in the future who's laptop exploded, fear not! Make a minimal install on the new hopefully , and I think my config will be in your laptop asap!

```sh
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed git base-devel
git clone https://github.com/New9c/workflow
cd workflow
chmod u+x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
