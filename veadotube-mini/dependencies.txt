most distros come with everything you need to run the bare minimum of veadotube!
if you're having issues, ensure that you have installed these packages:

- for text to show up: freetype & harfbuzz
- for neural networks (e.g. Silero VAD) to work: onnxruntime
- for the Oculus Lipsync plugin to work: wine (9.6 or greater)

the steps to install packages vary from distro to distro, so we're not including
those here.

the app does use SDL3, but it already comes with a sdl3.so library file so that
you don't have to worry about installing it. in any case, you can delete that
file in order to use a system-provided SDL3, if you happen to have it installed!
